I believe LLM's could make it so the turtle can include a menu that can change color via implementing HTML with the python code or another language in some way. I believe LLMs should be used in class depending on a few restrictions.
First, it should always be stated how and where an LLM is used.
Second, it can't be all LLM code, a majority has to be original.
LLMs are a good way to implement ambitious but creative idea's that may be too complicated to implement otherwise. (or just this absurd formula for an oval)
